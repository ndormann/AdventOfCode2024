# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), implemented in Rust.

## About
This repository contains my personal solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.
As someone new to Rust, I’m using this as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of the language
while tackling fun and engaging programming puzzles.

## Repository Structure
- **Input Files:** Stored in `/data`, where each puzzle’s input is saved.
- **Source Code:** Located in `/src`.
- **Common Code:** Shared utilities and traits are defined in `/src/prelude.rs`.
- **Execution:** All puzzle solutions implement the `Aoc2024` trait and are orchestrated through `main.rs`.

## Why This Repository?
This repository serves as:
- A personal log of my progress in solving Advent of Code puzzles.
- A learning exercise to become more proficient in Rust by applying it to real-world problems.
